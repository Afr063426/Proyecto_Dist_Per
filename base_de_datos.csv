Whilst this assisted to alleviate some of the underinsurance problem, even with the (on average) additional 15% of funds, many individuals found themselves acutely underinsured and therefore cash settled. A further complexity for victims of this event was the nature of the property stock n the town (pre-event).

It weakened to a tropical low near Mount Isa around 10 pm on 3 February. In response to warnings about the expected severity of the cyclone, and possible storm surges, approximately 10,000 northern Queenslanders living in low-lying areas evacuated to more than 100 official evacuation centres. Significant numbers were accommodated in unofficial evacuation centres established by communities and church groups. Thousands of people left the area and sought refuge with family and friends. Flights out of the region were fully booked. The hospital's 300 patients were evacuated to Brisbane and other regional hospitals by the the Australian Defence Force, Royal Flying Doctor Service and other means of transportation.

The eye, with very destructive wind gusts up to 220 km/h within a 20 km radius, reached the far northern coast of the Australian state of Queensland between 6 am and 9 am on 10 March 2005 AEST, and hit the Cape York Peninsula. However, it was downgraded to a Category 2 storm as it crossed the peninsula north of the towns of Coen and Lockhart River. After passing the town of Weipa, Ingrid gained strength once again as it moved out across the Gulf of Carpentaria towards the Northern Territory. It struck the town of Nhulunbuy as a Category 5 storm. It crossed the Cobourg Peninsula in the early hours of 13 March, heading west. Ingrid struck the Tiwi Islands as a Category 4 storm, and moved west into the Timor Sea, being downgraded to a category 3 due to the passage over land. Winds were in excess of 200 km/h. On 15 March Ingrid approached the north coast of the Kimberley region of Western Australia as a Category 4 storm, and made landfall near Kalumburu shortly afterwards. It quickly weakened as it moved inland, and soon completely dissipated.The isolated communities along the coast of Northern Territory suffered considerable damage, and there was localised flooding in the coastal areas due to high tides. On Croker Island, 30 homes sustained damage, some of which lost their roofs, numerous trees were downed, power was cut to most residences, cars were completely destroyed and numerous roads were damaged.[9] Nearly all trees on the island were leveled by 290 km/h (180 mph) wind gusts. Schools were reportedly destroyed in addition to several homes. Much of the infrastructure of the Tiwi Islands was affected, some suffering consequential damage due to trees falling on buildings and vehicles. Damages on the islands amounted to A$5 million ($3.9 million USD).  Throughout the Northern Territory, an additional A$10 million ($6.4 million USD) in damages resulted from Ingrid.

Broome experienced strong winds with gale-force gusts, some heavy rain and heavy seas but escaped serious damage. Fay then headed further away from the coast on the 25th before resuming a general southerly track on the 26th. Fay crossed the Pilbara coast between the pastoral stations of Pardoo and Wallal between 8 am and 9 am WST on 27 March as a Category 4 storm with estimated maximum wind gusts of around 235 km/h near the center. The cyclone weakened as it moved inland. Little wind damage was reported from the storm despite its intensity as it made landfall in a remote part of the WA coast and consequently only impacted sparsely populated pastoral and mining areas. As the system passed close to the Yarrie mine its translation speed reduced and some 200 workers were locked down for 8 hours in two squash courts as accommodation units were overturned, water tanks ""shredded"" and power lines cut.

Undeclared,Cyclone KERRY,12/19/1979,4/19/1979,1979-80,QLD,,"Kerry was a remarkable tropical cyclone having a long life-span and erratic track. It is also notorious for being only one of two cyclones in the Australian region to have an airplane (a US NOAA research aircraft) fly into the cyclone (the other being TC Rosa ). Indeed a wind speed of 252 km/h measured by this aircraft at an altitude of 540 m was at that time one of the strongest low-level winds measured in a cyclone in the Australian area. Kerry 's origin is linked to a low that became evident near 5?S, 170?E on 7 February 1979. By 10 February 1979 some cyclonic curvature could be detected in the surrounding convective cloud field. Three days later the system was displaying consistent organisation. The subsequent erratic track is shown below. Kerry intensified steadily while moving west-southwest at 15 to 35 km/h and by 15 February 1979 was classified as a severe tropical cyclone. As Kerry crossed the Solomon Islands maximum observed winds were 72 km/h at about 70 km south of the cyclone, however widespread destruction and loss of life were experienced near the centre, indicating the existence of much stronger winds.. Estimated winds from satellite data were 125 to 145 km/h. After moving away from the Solomon Islands on a southwesterly track, Kerry again intensified steadily. Maximum intensity was attained on 19 February 1979 and Kerry then slowly weakened while moving towards landfall on 1 March 1979. Kerry moved erratically around a large loop from 19 to 26 February 1979 crossing its own track at least three times. A factor in the decay after 19 February was the intrusion of dry sub-tropical air that moved around the west and northwest of the cyclone. This is a common feature of decaying cyclones in the Australian region. Aircraft reconnaissance flights on 21 and 22 February 1979 and satellite imagery together show evidence of this dry air and suppressed convection in these quadrants. As Kerry approached the coast across the Whitsunday Islands radar surveillance showed a weak vortex with a ragged and poorly defined eye, but winds of over 108 km/h were observed. Kerry moved west-northwest over land for just over a day then moved northward back over the Coral Sea. The cyclone began to re-intensify east of Townsville late on 2 March 1979. This re-intensification continued while the cyclone moved northward to be east of Cairns on 3 March. Later that day Kerry came under the influence of strong northwesterly winds ahead of an appraoching large amplitude upper-level trough and accelerated to the southeast, weakened and decayed over the ocean on 6 March 1979. Although Kerry was a severe cyclone while well offshore, it had weakened considerably by the time it made landfall and only minor wind damage occurred in some coastal centres and offshore resorts.Nevertheless, boats collectively worth hundreds of thousands of dollars were damaged or destroyed in Mackay harbour on 1 March 1979. Twenty-four hour rainfall totals of up to 250 mm were reported from mainland centres with an isolated fall of 402 mm from Hayman Island in the Whitsunday Group . Little flood damage resulted however.",FNQ,Cyclone,1979,,,,,,,,,,,,
Undeclared,Cyclone ROSA,11/19/1979,3/19/1979,1979-80,QLD NT WA,,"A persisting cloud cluster was initially detected on satellite photographs near the Solomon Islands on 12 February 1979. The system moved westward and became a tropical depression near Samarai on 14 February 1979. The low moved to the Gulf of Carpentaria where the track became very erratic. The system intensified over the Gulf and attained cyclone strength by 0000 UTC 25 February 1979. The track of the system after 0000 UTC 25 February 1979 is depicted below. The cyclone crossed the coast 30 km north-northwest of Bing Bong homestead at 0400 UTC 26 February 1979 with an estimated central pressure of 955 hPa, the lowest pressure during its life cycle. The lowest recorded pressure was 993.3 hPa at Centre Island (in the Sir Edward Pellew Group ) at 0000 UTC 26 February 1979. The NOAA research aircraft investigated the cyclone on a single mission as the cyclone was making landfall. At the point of closest approach at 0440 UTC 26 February 1979 the maximum wind encountered was 169 km/h at an altitude of 540 m, 37 km northeast of the centre of the eye. The eye diameter was 37 km. The highest 24-hour rainfall totals were 79 mm at McArthur River on 27 February and 74.2 mm at Centre Island on 26 February. An unofficial report from Nathan River estimated 250 mm on 26 February. The highest cumulative total for the period 20 to 28 February 1979 was 197.8 mm at Centre Island. Coastal and riverside stations in the southwest Gulf of Carpentaria reported unusually high tides. Seas were very rough at Bing Bong where the water level was estimated to have risen two metres above the spring high tide mark. A tide gauge on Groote Eylandt was washed away. Thousands of dollars worth of structural damage to station properties, together with the felling of extensive tracts of forest, were reported in the southwest Gulf of Carpentaria and Roper-McArthur district.

CAT793,Port Broughton Hailstorm,11/14/1979,11/14/1979,1979-80,SA,,"On 14 November 1979 Port Broughton sustained damage from a line of ferocious storms that hit south-eastern South Australia. Very strong winds and hail ruined solid brick houses, holiday shacks and caravans. Cars were pushed sideways along the road and pine trees up to 30 m tall were uprooted. There was no loss of life during the event which was considered amazing. Eleven people were injured requiring hospital admission and 60 others required hospital treatment. While Port Broughton incurred the most damage, other areas were also affected. Destruction was felt from the mid north to northern Adelaide Plains. Clare experienced severe damage. Houses lost their roofs and sheds were demolished in the high winds. Likewise the northern suburbs of Adelaide saw houses unroofed and trees blown over in areas such Salisbury North, Parafield Gardens, and Munno Para. Agriculture was severely impacted with crops damaged, glass houses broken, grape vines stripped, storage tanks squashed, orchards destroyed and many farmers' livelihoods, built up over many years, were lost within ten minutes. According to the Bureau of Meteorology Regional Forecasting Centre, the thunderstorm triggered by the trough line that extended across Yorke Peninsula moved over Port Broughton and produced destructive winds. The winds at all levels through the atmosphere were very strong. A thunderstorm is classified as severe if it produces wind gusts of 90 km per hour of more. On this day gusts were much higher with reports of 135 km per hour to 160 km per hour. Isolated large hail coming from very cold air high above the earth's surface was rapidly transported to the surface by downdrafts and accompanied the thunderstorms associated with the trough immediately to the east causing damage to some of Adelaide?s northern suburbs.",,Hailstorm,1979,10000000,112700125,,,,,,,,,,

By the evening of 6 January 1979 it was centred just to the north of the New Hebrides Group with a central pressure well below 990 hPa. Satellite imagery during 6 January 1979 showed a clearly discernible circular eye and the cyclone was at its most intense. Gordon moved south-southwest towards New Caledonia until 7 January When it gradually turned to a more westerly track. Throughout 7 and 8 January 1979 satellite photographs indicated a marked weakening of the system. Reports from ships in the area and offshore automatic weather stations indicated winds generally from 55 to 70 km/h with one report of 83 km/h from Frederick Reef early on 10 January 1979. Throughout 10 January Gordon continued to weaken and lost all tropical cyclone characteristics: it continued to move westward, however, as a tropical low. On the following morning, the low changed to a west-southwesterly track and winds to 83 km/h were reported from offshore and coastal areas as the system approached the coast. It crossed the coast just south of Proserpine early on 12 January 1979 and rapidly decayed. Twenty-four hourly rainfall totals of up to 50 mm occurred in some coastal areas as the low crossed the coast but no significant structural damage or flooding was directly attributable to Gordon . Strong winds and rough seas that developed along the central and parts of the south coast of Queensland, however, caused some beach erosion in those areas.",FNQ,Cyclone,1979,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the next few days the weak, complex low, which remained after Peter , migrated slowly westwards across the southeast and southern Gulf. By late on 7 January 1979 satellite photographs indicated a weak circulation. The system exhibited an erratic course to the northeast of Groote Eylandt and did not intensify until it began to move in an east-northeasterly direction after 2000 UTC 8 January 1979. The path of the low continued in an east-northeasterly direction, with gradual deepending to cyclone intensity and acceleration as it crossed the Gulf. Ship reports at 2100 UTC 9 January 1979 indicated 68 km/h winds 270 km north-northwest of the centre and near 68 km/h winds 100 km to the east-northeast. Greta , moving eastwards at 25 km/h, crossed the coast between 0200 UTC,and 0300 UTC 10 January 1979 about 20 km south of Weipa. Weipa recorded a maximum gust of 78 km/h and a 30-minute calm as the cyclone passed, as well as a minimum pressure of 986 hPa. Little damage was experienced. Greta maintained a well-marked cyclonic circulation during its continued eastward overland movement, but then crossed the Cape York Peninsula east coast, changed course to the south-southeast and then moved parallel to the coast at 15 km/h. The coast was re-crossed at 0500 UTC 11 January in Princess Charlotte Bay with an estimated central pressure of 990 hPa. Banding features remained evident on satellite pictures as it moved inland in a west-southwest direction. It eventually passed close to Alice Springs at 0200 UTC 16 January 1979 with a central pressure near 996 hPa.

During 14 April the cyclone accelerated as it approached the Queensland coast and,crossed the coast approximately 40 km north of Weipa at about 0800 UTC. The system moved rapidly across Cape York Peninsuila and into the Coral Sea, decaying during this passage and with the estimated central pressure rising to 1002 hPa. 'The system continued to move east-southeastwards as a tropical low and was unidentifiable on 16 April 1979. The highest reported wind associated with Stan was 74 km/h on 12 April 1979 at Cape Wessel. Estimates derived from satellite imagery indicated that the strongest winds associated with Stan were of the same order. At no time was an eye discernible on satellite photographs. The highest 24-hour rainfall associated with Stan was 233 mm at Iron Range on 15 April. Other 24-hour falls included 127 mrn at Moreton and 84 mm at Weipa.

Twenty people were injured and 50 buildings destroyed. In Perth buildings swayed for three minutes, and tremors were felt up to 700km from the epicentre. Before the earthquake, Meckering had 51 dwellings, 12 businesses and 15 public buildings. Only 16 houses and three businesses survived. The ground ruptured in a scarp 37km long, and where the fault crossed the highway, the road was split by a step 1.5m high. Railway lines buckled and a water main folded upon itself. The earthquake lasted 45 seconds and was felt over an area of 700kms in radius and caused damage in many towns. The quake focus was 7km deep and had the force equivalent of 10 Hiroshima type atomic bombs. The largest land displacement measured a westward heave of 2.44m, a southerly slip of 1.5m and vertical lift of 1.96m. The principal fault scarp of the Meckering earthquake was originally 37 km long, aligned approx N-S, of which the Great Eastern Highway was bisected 4.4km West of Meckering township.  The Meckering Earthquake was located in a well-documented zone of seismic activity which is the most active region of Australia. This region is centred about 150 kilometres east of Perth and is known as the South-West Seismic Zone (SWSZ) and measures roughly 300 kilometres by 500 kilometres.

CAT672,Bushfire,7/19/1967,7/19/1967,1967-68,TAS,,"An event which became known as the Black Tuesday bushfires. Reported at the time as the most deadly bushfires that Tasmania has ever experienced, leaving 62 people dead, 900 injured and over seven thousand homeless. 110 separate fire fronts burnt through some 2,640 square kilometres (652,000 acres) of land in Southern Tasmania within the space of five hours. Fires raged from near Hamilton and Bothwell to the D'Entrecasteaux Channel as well as Snug. There was extensive damage to agricultural property along the Channel, the Derwent Valley and the Huon Valley. Fires also destroyed forest, public infrastructure and properties around Mount Wellington and many small towns along the Derwent estuary and east of Hobart. The worst of the fires was the Hobart Fire, which encroached upon the city of Hobart. In total, the fires claimed 62 lives in a single day. Property loss was also extensive with 1293 homes and over 1700 other buildings destroyed. The fires destroyed 80 bridges, 4800 sections of power lines, 1500 motor vehicles and over 100 other structures. It was estimated that at least 62,000 farm animals were killed.

Tropical Cyclone Glenda moved south 500 km east of Brisbane, resulting in large waves eroding Gold Coast beaches. Waves up to 16 m off the South Queensland Coast were reported where six men lost their lives in two separate boating incidents. Glenda was last of a series of cyclones and beaches along the south coast of Queensland were further eroded. The erosion came within 20 yards of the new Coolangatta SLSC and the patio was damaged by subsidence. The Maranui at 1520UTC 4 April was located at 30.00S 158.50E wind turned southerly/75 knots MSLP 985.4 hPa. At 2000UTC located at 29.60S 158.00E wind SW/70knots MSLP 981.6hPa. On 2300UTC 1 April the 9000 ton White Ocean was 100 mi south of the centre in waves generally less than 20 feet in height. But occasionally waves were much higher and crashed into the superstructure 50 feet above the waterline. The Capt and 3rd officer were caught on the forecastle on one of these waves. The third officer was killed and the Capt badly injured. The 33ft Beagle was anchored in the lee of Double Island Point at 0830UTC 2 April when the boat was caught broadside by a huge wave and broken up with 5 of the crew of 6 were drowned.

TC moved SSE past the South Coast. Severe flooding occurred in the Brisbane Creeks and in the Logan River. Further beach erosion. As Elaine was developing into a cyclone from the 14th to the 16th just to the east of Cairns, torrential rain fell in the North Coast Herbert and Barron Divisions. The major feature of the months flooding was the record flooding in the Herbert. Falls of up to 1321 mm in 4 days in the Barron and Herbert districts produced the highest flood on record in the Herbert River. The Bureau?s river height observer at Glen Eagle station was forced to evacuate his homestead, shortly before it was washed away in a flood which reached the level of 6.85 metres above the previous record in 1927. The bridge at Long Pocket linking Abergowrie and Ingham was washed away after being almost 15metres under water, and the population of Abergowrie was isolated for weeks. Ingham itself was almost completely submerged in the flood_waters which were 17 kilometres wide at the peak. Road and rail traffic were brought to a stand_still, and Hinchinbrook Shire Council is reported to have estimated road and bridge damage alone at about $7.5 million. Near record flooding was also reported in the Barron, Johnstone and Tully The damage to sugar mill tramlines and bridges was severe. Huge fields of sugar cane were washed out and in some places cane has been covered by 2 metres of silt. Cars were washed into raging flood_waters and costly farm machinery inundated. Thousands of people had the heart_breaking experience of flood damage due to knee deep water in their homes and when this receded, 300mm of mud.

It recurved and passed over Sandy Cape which recorded a central pressure of 944.8 hPa and high water 10 metres above normal. Although well off the coast many trees were blown down from Rockhampton to Grafton. Houses were unroofed at Bundaberg, Maryborough and along the Sunshine and Gold Coasts. Huge seas and storm surge caused severe erosion at Emu Park, Yeppoon, and in the Maryborough Bundaberg area. At Bargara winds tore off a large section of roofing from a unit in Clarke Street and a number of other houses suffered damage. A 75 foot tower was blown over. At Burnett Heads the sea crossed beach front roads and flooded low lying properties. The Catholic Church had most of its roof torn off. A storm surge of 2 metres covered the flats inland from Double Island Point and a storm surge inundated cane farms at Bli Bli on the Sunshine Coast and was knee deep in Hastings St Noosa. Around Sandgate seawater 1.5 metres deep came into houses. More than one hundred homes were flooded and at Cribb Island one house was washed into the sea. At nearby Nudgee beach the sea wall was destroyed and houses were flooded with 0.66 metres of salt water. Storm surge also affected the Gold Coast and water lapped the decking of the Jubilee Bridge which is about 1.5 metres above highest astronomical tide. A similar storm occurred on the Tweed River isolating Fingal. A section of the esplanade collapsed at Surfers Paradise and the unprecedented 1967 severe erosion on the Gold Coast had begun.
